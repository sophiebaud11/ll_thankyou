# Dear LL Staff...

From all of us LLUFs, thank you for your support and understanding throughout this semester. We're so grateful to you guys for all you've done to make these past few weeks work for all of us & keep morale up. We love you all, so we decided to throw together a little "Thank You" compilation to celebrate the (often unsung) Bok Center staff!

While all of us send our thanks, a bunch of LLUFs have written/designed/recorded some of their own unique creations to do so:
